Credit: This a fork from the orignal fastai course repo from 2018. We decided to drop the history to make the repo minimal since we'll only be working on a very small part of the original codebase, working with the repository is currently expensive (even when using a shallow clone) due to the large number of commits.

## What is this?
This is a fork of the incredible fastai ML Course taught in 2018. 

## What is fastai-remastered?
This is repo is part of the fast-ml course that's being prepared by the W&B Community. As of now, it's a simple remaster of the ML course from fastai. In the future, we plan to add more utilities and features supporitng different frameworks and teaching you about boosted algorithms.
